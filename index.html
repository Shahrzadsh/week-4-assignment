               <img src="images/photo.jpg" width="400" alt="myself">
               <p> My name is Shahrzad. I am originally from Iran. I was born in 2 <sup>nd</sup> April 1984 and I lived in a beautiful corneal Island that called Kish that is located in the middle of Persian Gulf. I studied French literature as a <abbr title="Master of Arts"> MA </abbr> degree but all of my life I had passionate about art and what is related to art. last year I came to Canada with my family as a doctorate student but I changed my mind to follow this powerful and brawny thing in my life: <em>Art</em>.</p>
               <p>I chose program of <strong>Interactive media design </strong>in <strong> Algonquin college</strong> in Ottawa. I would like to improve all my skills that will be offered in IMD program, I am eager in learning and developing my area of knowledge about digital design and web design and also, I hope to become more familiar with perspective of each carrier to find my appropriate future field. </p>
